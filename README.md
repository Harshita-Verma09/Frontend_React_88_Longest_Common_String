## üí° Algorithm

The `longestCommonPrefix` function works as follows:

1.  **Handle Empty Array:** If the input array of strings is empty, it returns an empty string.
2.  **Sort the Array:** It sorts the array of strings alphabetically. This is a clever optimization because, after sorting, the longest common prefix will always be the common prefix of the *first* and *last* strings in the sorted array.
3.  **Compare First and Last:** It then iterates through the characters of the first string and the last string, comparing them character by character.
4.  **Build Prefix:** As long as the characters match, they are part of the common prefix. The iteration stops at the first mismatch.
5.  **Return Prefix:** Finally, it returns the substring of the first string from index 0 up to the point where the characters matched.
